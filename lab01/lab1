1) A file ".bash_profile" is invoked only when invoking as a login shell.
   A file ".bashrc" is invoked when bash is not invoked as a login shell. It is the first file that will be read and executed.

2) File is attached

3) I can see that all the files in the directory are displayed with the permissions

4) chmod 644 - "Read & Write" access for me, "Read" to everyone else

5) chmod 755 - All permissions (Read, Write and Execute) for me, "Read & Execute" to everyone else

11) ls * - lists all the files 
    ls a* - lists all the files that begin with "a"
    ls *m* - lists all the files that have "m" in between other letters 
    ls anno? - lists all the files that start with "anno" with 1 character in the end
    ls annoy? - Nothing is listed..because it should have listed all the files that start with "annoy" with 1 character in the end. There are no such files in the directory.

13) echo Is a < b? 	- No such file or directory
    echo "Is a < b?" 	- Is a < b?

    echo '\$USER is $USER' - $USER is $USER
    echo "Today is `date`" - Today is Fri Sep 29 15:06:14 EDT 2017
    echo "Today is $(date)" - Today is Fri Sep 29 15:08:03 EDT 2017
    echo 'Today is `date`' - Today is `date`
