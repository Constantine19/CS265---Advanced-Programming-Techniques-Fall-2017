1.1 

Lines 1 & 2 are okay, but not necessary, because it is known that 0 - FALSE and 1 - TRUE
Line 4 "ch" is too vague and "EOF" is not descriptive
Line 5 is not very well formatted with a dash

1.2

int isSmaller(char *s, char *t) {
	return (strcmp(s, t) < 1)
	}
	
1.3 

I've read it aloud. It's hard to understand the code, but looks like it will do something if disk space allocation is successfull

1.4 

if ( c != 'y' || c != 'Y' )
	return;
	
if (lenght > BUFSIZE)
		lenght = BUFSIZE;
		
flag = !flag;

quote = (*line = '"')

bit = (val & 1) == 1;

1.5

Function "read" in line 1 takes an int pointer as a parameter, however, in line 6 it is passed as a parameter, rather than a pointer. Furthermore, the naming is poorly formatted.

1.7

if (!stty(stdin) && !istty(stdout) && !istty(stderr))
	return 0;
	
return retval

for (k=0; k<4; k++) {
	scanf("%lf", &dx);
	x += dx;
}

1.8

If this is a boolen function, it can never return a boolen value if the value doesn't evaluate to True

for (int count = 0; count < total; count++){
	if ( this.getName(count) == nametable.userName()){
		return (true);
	}
}
return (false);
	
1.9

Missing parenthesis around the variable "c". Variable "c" is referenced 2 times, therefore it could be evaluated 2 times.

#define ISDIGIT(c) (((c >= '0') && (c <= '9')) ? 1 : 0)

1.10

We can redefine all constants as variables, rather than macros and change the names in order to better understand the purpose.

const double METER_PER_FEET 0.3048
const double FEET_PER_METER 3.2084
const double FEET_PER_MILE 5280.0
const double KILOMETER_PER_MILE 1.609344
const double SQUARE_KM_PER_SQUARE_MILE 2.589988

1.11

#1 Comment should be above the function. Moreover, "Void" doesn't return anything

#2 The function checks for "n" being within a bond or if it is uneven. Comment doesn't mention "MAX".

#3 1st 2 comments are not necesseraly needed, they don't explain what the messages are about.
   Comment 3 & 4 are not needed as-well, because they are dublicates and the purpose of the increment is obvious.
