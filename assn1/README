Requirements: before running each script, the variable ARCHIVE needs to be specified with the required path

1. prob1 

This script prints the total number of directories and messages within the path that is set to variable ARCHIVE

2. prob2

This script determines how many messages are in the longest thread and prints out the number of the messages

3. prob3

This script takes the year, month and day (Example: bash prob3 2003 11 27) as command-line arguments and returns a list of messages that were sent on that day

NOTE: It was not mentioned in the assignment, but I have also added the IF statement at the beginning to check if there are 3 arguments passed. 

4. prob4

This script determine the number of distinct hostnames as-well as how many messages were sent from each
