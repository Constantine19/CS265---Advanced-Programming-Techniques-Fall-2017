CS 265 Lab7 - Konstantin Zelmanovich

1) 

i. Hide implementation details

	It means that implementation of a program must be hidden so that they can be changed without involving users

ii. Choose a small orthogonal set of primitives

	It means that interface should provide a set of only necessary info and functions

iii. Don't reach behind the user's back

	It means that interface should only do what it has and supposed to do and should do nothing that user is not not aware about

iv. Do the same thing the same way everywhere

	It means that similar things must be done the same way and consistancy has to be maintained for implementation algorithms, functions etc


2) This implementation does not properly handle empty fields, commas within double and escaped quotes

3) This implementation can properly handle empty fields, commas within double and escaped quotes

4) Can not read a csv file correctly and it is not possible to parse multiple files, because C is not an object oriented and doesn't have classes

5) C++ implementation does not solve the issues, still not possible to handle empty fields

6) Yes
