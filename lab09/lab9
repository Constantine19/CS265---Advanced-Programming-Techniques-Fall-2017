1. Segmentation fault and a new file called "core" created in the directory

2. inTable() at strcmp()

3. 
	a. bug1.c - was not compiling, fixed by changing scanf( "%d", n ) to scanf( "%d", &n )
	b. bug2.c - compiling, but with a wrong output, fixed by changing printf("Pi=%d, n=%f\n", pi, n) to printf("Pi=%f, n=%d\n", pi, n)
	c. bug3.c - was not compiling with in.bug3 as an input, changed the increment of numLines from before to after the call
	d. avg.c - was not compiling, fixed by changing scanf("%d",n) to scanf("%d",&n)
	e. The pivot element was not moving to the 1st position 
		swap(v,0,rand() % n)
		assert((last >= 0) && (last < n))
		
4. Compiler can not catch this, because can only catch syntax errors and we were passing pointers to the functions and not actual data types

5. It will fail with the segmentation fault
